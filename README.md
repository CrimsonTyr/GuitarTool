# GuitarTool
GuitarTool is a little application I created to help me learn the notes' location on my guitar fretboard.
It is developed using python with the pygame library.

- "guitar_tool.exe" has been created using pyinstaller. If you want to use this .exe instead of the "GuitarToolInstaller.exe",
  make sure you download the "assets" folder as well, and make sure both this .exe and the "assets" folder are in the same folder !

- "logo.ico" is the icon file I used to create the .exe (using pyinstaller -i)

- "GuitarToolInstaller.exe" has been created using NSIS. You can download this .exe to install GuitarTool easier
  as it will automatically install the "guitar_tool.exe" and the "assets" folder needed where you want.

"guitar_tool.exe" as well as "GuitarToolInstaller.exe" should not need you to have python nor pygame installed in order to work
